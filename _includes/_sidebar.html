		<h3>About this blog</h3>
		<p>
			Today the bulk of my time is spent working in a SOC, doing TryHackMe challenges, 
			and completing CTF<br>challenges. I strive to be the best blue teamer I can be. 
			I believe the only way to effectively defend a network is to learn how to attack it. 
			I plan on using this blog as a way to share the knowledge I've learned to help<br>individuals learn more about<br>cybersecurity and as a reference for my future self.
